# PIC32-RoboCar
Robot Car Implementation Sample

### Stages
- Track and follow the white line using PID control (Easier Task). 
- Using WiFi geolocation data to program the car shoot a ball into the gantry
- Using the WiFi geolocation data and communication between cars to do several specified action like pass the ball, catch the ball and shoot the ball
Details :

### Details
- Use C to implement the PIC32 chip
- Use Ring Buffer and AT-CMD to send / receive / setup WiFi-Module by C
- Controlling PWM outputs by inferred sensors.
- Applying PID control method
- Applying geometry algorithms for stage 2 and 3 
- Finite State Machine control
